# Copilot Instructions for MCA-SEM1 Python Notebooks

## Project Overview
This workspace contains multiple Jupyter notebooks focused on Python programming concepts for MCA Semester 1. Each notebook covers a specific topic, such as data structures, strings, functions, and slicing. The code is primarily educational, demonstrating Python syntax and features through concise examples.

## Key Files and Structure
- All content is in Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb`) at the root of the workspace.
- Notebooks include: `Datastructures.ipynb`, `Dictionary.ipynb`, `Functions and modules.ipynb`, `slicingg.ipynb`, `strings.ipynb`, `Tuples and Lists.ipynb`, `comprehension.ipynb`.
- Each notebook is self-contained and does not import from others.

## Coding Patterns
- Code cells demonstrate Python features with short, direct examples.
- Markdown cells provide explanations and context for each concept.
- No external Python packages are required; all code uses standard library features.
- Variable naming is simple and descriptive, matching the concept being taught (e.g., `my_tuple`, `fruits`, `address`).
- String manipulation, tuple/list operations, and basic control flow are common themes.

## Developer Workflow
- Open notebooks in VS Code or Jupyter and run cells interactively.
- No build or test steps are required; code is executed directly in the notebook environment.
- Debugging is done by running cells and observing output.

## Project Conventions
- Each notebook is focused on a single topic; avoid cross-notebook dependencies.
- Use clear, commented code to illustrate concepts.
- Prefer Python 3 syntax and idioms.
- Keep examples concise and readable for educational clarity.

## Example Patterns
- Tuple creation and indexing:
  ```python
  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
  print(my_tuple)
  print(my_tuple[1])
  ```
- String splitting and joining:
  ```python
  quote = "Life before death, courage before despair, journey before destination"
  split_quote = quote.split()
  print(" ".join(split_quote))
  ```
- List enumeration:
  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
      print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")
  ```

## Integration Points
- No external APIs, databases, or services are integrated.
- All code is standalone and suitable for direct execution in a notebook cell.
